## A new means of performing with repurposed devices

**Bendit_I/O** is a system that allows for wireless, networked performance of circuit-bent devices, giving artists a new outlet for performing with repurposed technology. In a typical setup, a user pre-bends a device using the Bendit_I/O board as an intermediary, replacing physical switches and potentiometers with the boardâ€™s reed relays, motor driver, and digital potentiometer signals. 
Bendit_I/O brings the networking techniques of distributed music performances to the hardware hacking realm, opening the door for creative implementation of multiple circuit-bent devices in audiovisual experiences. Consisting of a Wi-Fi- enabled I/O board and a Node-based networking server, Bendit_I/O provides performers with a wide option of digital performance interfaces for controlling their hacked devices. Moreover, the Bendit_I/O system is user-friendly, low-cost, and modular, making it a flexible toolset for artists of diverse experience levels.
