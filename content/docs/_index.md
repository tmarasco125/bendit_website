## A new means of performing with repurposed devices

**BendIt.io** is a system that allows for wireless, networked performance of circuit-bent devices, giving artists a new outlet for performing with repurposed technology. In a typical setup, a user pre-bends a device using the BendIt.io board as an intermediary, replacing physical switches and potentiometers with the boardâ€™s reed relays, motor driver, and digital potentiometer signals. 
BendIt.io brings the networking techniques of distributed music performances to the hardware hacking realm, opening the door for creative implementation of multiple circuit-bent devices in audiovisual experiences. Consisting of a Wi-Fi- enabled I/O board and a Node-based networking server, BendIt.io provides performers with a wide option of digital performance interfaces for controlling their hacked devices. Moreover, the BendIt.io system is user-friendly, low-cost, and modular, making it a flexible toolset for artists of diverse experience levels.
